# Frontend_Mini_Project

In this project, I used HTML and CSS to build an interactive website (front end) for ShashiÂ Catering Services, which are offered on our campus. I then hosted the website on Github.
There are four sections and a navigation bar on this website overall. Home, Services we offer, Clients, and Contact form each have their own separate sections in HTML.
We created the background graphics and styling for these four parts using CSS. We also made the navbar sticky so that it would always be at the top of the screen and added smooth scrolling.

When viewing a website from any form of device, the Phone.css file is used, and basically styling commands are given in this file.
